            In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
        </p>
        <p class="heading_13">
            Surely all praise belongs to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala, Who is the Most Merciful and the Most Merciful. We
            seek refuge in Him from the evils of our hearts and the evils of our deeds. Blessings and peace be upon the
            greatest human being. Prophet Muhammad.<br>
            Marriage is a special blessing from Allah Almighty and an important Sunnah of the Prophet . Marriage is
            mentioned in Quran and Hadith as a means of purity, half of religion and means of financial prosperity. On
            the other hand, while chasing after this sick competition of the so-called equality of men and women of
            Westernism, the society is losing morality. The main reason for the infiltration of the uncivilized culture
            of the West in education, work, marriage is not following Islamic rules and lack of complete religious
            education. As a result, mamage has become difficult and the society is burdened with various degradations
            including adultery, adultery, rape, suicide. <br>
            On the other hand, finding a suitable life partner has become very difficult for those who are struggling
            against family and so-called social norms to cling to the Sunnah by going against the current in this age of
            terrible fitnah. In order to solve this problem, some of us sinners dreamed of an open Bangladeshi Muslim
            matrimony platform. As a result, jibonsathi.org started its journey on 21 July 2023.<br>
            Jeevansathi is a non-profit platform and is run entirely on donations. So, as you can imagine, it can stop
            functioning at any time. But, no. You will be glad to know that. Alhamdulillah, by the will of Allah
            Subhanahu wa Ta'ala. the efforts of some generous minded benefactors have made a lasting settlement to keep
            the Jeevansaathi platform operational. A group of religious young people who are experienced in IT have
            selflessly come forward for technical support. Also some Islamic scholars are in charge as its overall
            monitoring and advisor. However, none of them are interested in revealing their personal identity. Wants to
            work selfiessly behind the scenes. However, in this age of information and technology, it is not possible to
            provide services completely invisibly. So, I sincerely request your cooperation in this matter.<br>
            Those of you with experience in technology know how expensive and labor intensive it is to build and operate
            such a platform. Hence, it is almost impossible to render such service selfiessly. Moreover, no one does any
            work without self-interest nowadays. Yes, we are no exception. However, the spouse works in the interest of
            your love. We want your prayers and love, not money. And cooperating in the promotion of life partner will
            be the manifestation of that love.<br>
            The "Jeevansathi" platform is a revolutionary step taken to facilitate mariages legally, in the Islamic
            spirit, in the light of social norms. There is no substitute for choosing .<br>
            one's own personal choice of life partner before entering into matrimonial life in making earthly life happy
            and prosperous. Our walk is for the purpose of realizing that goal. This platform is taking such an
            unprecedented step where all the marriageable and marriageable boys and giris can submit their resume
            completely free of cost based on all the personal and family information with the permission of their
            parents. Or if you prefer to look at other resumes, you can contact the parent directly for free. Our Muslim
            brothers and sisters cannot follow all the rules of Islam properly. So that they can also avail our
            services, two different categories of resumes, general and Islamic, can be submitted and searched on our
            website. Thus, if the resume is selected, the parents of both families will proceed to the next step through
            Family .<br>
            Family communication. However, the Jeevansathi platform never supports direct phone contact with spouses.
            <br>
            Marriages that are conducted by employing middlemen or ghataks to conduct mamages in the present day, In
            many cases, many people admit to cheating just because most of the information is kept secret. Which is a
            big injustice. It is not possible to know much about the bride and groom and their guardians. Again, the
            Ghataks, with the aim of fulfilling their personal interests, often hide many things and entice the other
            party into marriage. Which later turned out to be a disaster for both the fames. As a result, they are
            forced to walk the path of separation. And the main reason for this is the wide gap of knowledge about both
            sides. Therefore, through caretul research, we have highlighted countless topics about which our life
            partner open platform is the only easy way to know and inquire. Where you can easily know the collection of
            detailed information of both parties without asking. Where there will be no third person, Being cheated or
            not will be entirely up to your own scrutiny. <br>
            Our aim is to build a Shariah-compliant Muslim matrimony platform for marriage through this website to
            facilitate the search for good spouses as life partners and contribute to building a beautiful and civilized
            society. To break all the bad culture of the present uncivilized society and to encourage marriages by
            stopping adultery, to make everyone aware against dowry as an eternal curse for the bride's family and to
            popularize Sunnah marriages with cash dowry. <br>
            Especially in this uncivilized society of ours, most of the marriages are done through illicit relationships
            like love and love. At some point, those relationships face separation. So, we want you to find a faithful
            life partner through our Muslim Matrimony, Because, a good life partner can bring your future to the peak of
            happiness. <br>
            Even the sun has taint. We are human. It's not that we don't make mistakes. However, always point out our
            mistakes and give us constructive criticism, Insh-sha-Allah, I will try to improve myself as much as
            possible. We only want your love as a worldly interest. If you want to be a part of that love or donate
            voluntarily by benefiting from our platform: That too will be spent on developing our platform. Please note
            that we do not accept donations through any other means than the payment channels mentioned on our website.
            We assure you that Jeebansathi platform service will be completely free for lifetime, Insha-Allah. Your life
            partner, we few sinners are just tools. Therefore, any plans. ideas, suggestions and constructive criticisms
            you may have to ensure better service of your platform are welcome.
            To make finding a good life partner easier and more fruitful, we have far-reaching plans which we are
            constantly researching. Our efforts will continue to efficiently deliver this service to all Muslim brothers
            and sisters. We pray to you that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala accepts and approves our selfless service as
            sadaqah in His Majesty's
            court and keeps our intention pure. May Allah ease all our good deeds and grant us Barakah, (a-min)
